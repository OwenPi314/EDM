AutoRecorder

The auto recorder starts a audio recording when you start talking
and ends recording when you stop talking.

Components:
  - Arduino Uno
  - SD card              (to store the recordings)
  - SD card adapter
  - Analog audio sensor  (for recording)
  - Digital audio sensor (for checking whether there is sound)

How it works:
  - It constantly checks for input to the digital sensor, once sound
    is detected, recording starts using the analog sensor
  - When no sound has been detected for a whole second, the recording
    stops and waits for the person to start talking again

  - The recorded audio files are stored on an SD card
  - The files are named in the format "naudio.wav" where n is the
    number of recordings before this one

Possible improvements:
1. There could be better settings for how long to wait before deciding
   that there is no sound
   - Perhaps a better setting can be obtained though machine learning?
   - Perhaps more testing?
